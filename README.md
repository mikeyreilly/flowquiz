# flowquiz

The idea is to be able to generate simple programs, display them to the user and ask the user what they output and keep score of how many correct and incorrect answers are given.

The programs will be in a simple language resembling BASIC.

Single uppercase letters are variable names; they are all integers.

Lines are labeled by numbers.

There are the usual arithmetic operators.

There is conditional and unconditional branching.

If I have time I will write something that turns these programs into flowcharts.
